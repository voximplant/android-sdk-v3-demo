# :feature:audiocall-incoming module

## Features

This module provides the UI to handle incoming audio calls.

Incoming call screen allows the user to see the caller name, accept, or decline the call.

A call can be started only if the microphone permission is granted.

Once a call is started, the application navigates to `:feature:audiocall-ongoing`.
