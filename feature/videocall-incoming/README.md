# :feature:videocall-incoming module

## Features

This module provides the UI to handle incoming video calls.

Incoming video call screen allows the user to see the caller name, accept, or decline the call.

A call can be started only if the microphone and camera permission are granted.

Once a call is started, the application navigates to `:feature:videocall-ongoing`.
